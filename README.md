# Ethical Keylogger (Educational Only)

**DISCLAIMER**  
This project is strictly for **educational and ethical purposes only i swear!**.  
Using keyloggers on systems or individuals without proper authorisation is **illegal** and may result in severe legal consequences hence the educational disclaimer.  
Use responsibly and only in environments where you have **explicit consent** (e.g., cybersecurity labs, personal testing, or portfolio demonstrations like this).
